<b>A blockchain-based platform for creative professionals to help their work to wider world.</b>

The platform addresses quite a few pain points faced by creative professionals in the present-day creative industry such as Low Pay or Pay disparity, lack of recognition. Thus, one of the key features of this platform is the use of smart contracts, which in turn automate several processes, such as payment, copyright and ownership management. 

Our proposed platform leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent and decentralized ecosystem for creative professionals. The platform would use smart contracts to automate payment, copyright, and ownership management. The smart contracts would ensure that creative professionals are paid fairly and promptly for their work. Moreover, the smart contracts would provide transparency in the payment process and ensure that the clients only pay for work that meets their quality standards. A dispute resolution mechanism would also be built-in to handle conflicts between clients and creative professionals.
